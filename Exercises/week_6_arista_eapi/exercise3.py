# Using your external YAML file and your function located in my_funcs.py, use pyeapi to connect to arista4.lasthop.io and retrieve "show ip route". 
# From this routing table data, extract all of the static and connected routes from the default VRF. 
# Print these routes to the screen and indicate whether the route is a connected route or a static route. 
# In the case of a static route, print the next hop address.
